# Python-Challenge
For the Python challenges I undertook, there were two distinct tasks. 

The first task involved analyzing the financial records of a company. It required determining the total number of months, calculating the net total profit and losses, computing changes in profits and losses, identifying the greatest increase and decrease in profits, and finally, generating an output text along with precise Python code to accomplish these tasks.

In the second challenge, I was assigned to develop a Python script to analyze votes, calculating the total number of votes cast, compiling a comprehensive list of candidates who received votes, determining the percentage of votes each candidate won, calculating the total number of votes each candidate received, and ultimately, printing out the winner of the election based on the votes. Again, the task demanded an accurate Python code along with an output text to showcase the results.
